Cooperative players disclose their actions, while less cooperative players often choose not to disclose to avoid influencing others negatively. This **selective disclosure can foster a cooperative norm** by highlighting lower extractions without spreading non-cooperative behavior.\n",
    "    - **FD (Free Disclosure)**: Allows **strategic manipulation** of shared information. Less cooperative players can misrepresent their extractions, signaling a low, socially optimal level, while actually extracting more. This behavior can erode trust, hinder the formation of a social norm, and potentially hasten resource depletion.\n",
