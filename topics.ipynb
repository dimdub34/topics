    "\n",
    "- Higher resource mobility decreases management efficiency and increases over-exploitation.\n",
    "- Single manager systems are more efficient and sustainable than multiple manager systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**\n",
    "- Emphasize the importance of coordinated management practices to mitigate the negative effects of resource mobility.\n",
    "- Support the implementation of property rights or centralized management to enhance resource sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ongoing Research**\n",
    "- Investigate the effects of asymmetry in the marginal productivity of the patches.\n",
    "- Introduce and study the impact of risk on the resource within the patches."
